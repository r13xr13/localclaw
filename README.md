##  Overview

**LYRA** WAS an advanced cyber intelligence platform engineered by **R13 Systems** to empower cybersecurity professionals, red teams, and trusted operators. It is designed to identify, profile, and respond to digital threats with tactical precision capable of both defense and simulated offense within a modular, secure execution zone.
**HELIX** on the other hand, Developed By c0smic in Partnership with R13 Systems. This is a whole New beast. Fully contained in one Stack

            HELIX INTELLIGENCE
          Autonomous Cyber Mind
--------------------------------------------------

**A Local AI-Powered Threat Intelligence Platform**
Built for operators who demand sovereignty, precision,  
and zero external dependencies.

**Why HELIX?**
- Offline by design  
- 145+ integrated tools  
- Multi-model AI brain  
- Graph intelligence mapping  
- Live playbook generation  
- Persistent memory for campaigns  
- Full incident-response automation pipeline  

**HELIX Thinks.  
HELIX Watches.  
HELIX Correlates.**  
All within your machine—never beyond it.

## Closing Directive

LYRA is not just a tool. It is a sovereign intelligence construct for those who operate in silence, where threat becomes pattern, and where defense is the art of precision and foresight.

This repository offers only the surface strata.  
The deeper code lives elsewhere bound, encrypted, awaiting command.

**For trusted operators only.**

>>> HELIX – THE NEXT EVOLUTION IS HERE

What started as Lyra Intelligence is now evolved.  
We took everything we learned from the Lyra PoC, burned it down, then rebuilt it from the ground up.

After hundreds of hours of non-stop grinding, real-world testing, and brutal feedback 
we’re proud to unleash **HELIX**.

### This is not another cloud kept secret “agent framework.”  
This is a Game changer.
What other's have promised, we have delivered plus a whole lot more.
Yaml Playbook's, Live Threat feed Intagration, Operator Contorlled, Agent Driven

**100% local · zero telemetry · air-gap ready · OPSEC-first**

### Core Pillars
- Runs entirely offline with quantized 13B–14B-class models (Mythomax-L2-13B & Qwen3-14B BaronLLM included)
- Neo4j graph brain that remembers every target, IOC, credential, and lesson forever
- Persistent JSON memory with schema validation and auto-learning
- YAML-driven playbooks (red team, blue team, OSINT, IR, compliance – all included)
- Asynchronous tool daemon with allow-listing, parsing, and automatic graph/memory ingestion
- Full Kali tool integration (nmap, nuclei, gobuster, sherlock, whois, amass, etc.) – parsed and weaponized instantly
- Live intel feeds (NVD, static IOCs, custom sources) with dynamic updating
- Multiple operation modes: autonomous, supervised, production, live console
- Zero internet required after initial setup – perfect for red cells, classified environments, or just pure paranoia

### What people are already doing with it
- Full autonomous OSINT profiling in < 15 minutes
- CVE-driven attack path generation and execution
- Incident response triage that writes the report for you
- Persistent, multi-session campaign orchestration that never forgets

This is the system we always wanted but nobody else built.

The PoC got attention.  
HELIX is going to break the internet.

Welcome to the new era.


- `/osint-legacy/`: The OSINT plugin is part of the LYRA ecosystem.  
  Core agent, orchestration, and memory modules are confidential and not included.
